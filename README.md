Hieroglyph Translation Project

Overview

Welcome to the Hieroglyph Translation Project! This repository contains tools and models to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs into modern languages using advanced machine learning techniques. We utilize a custom-trained T5 model hosted on Hugging Face for textual translations and custom-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, trained on a hand-curated dataset of hieroglyphic symbols.

Features

Textual Translation: Convert hieroglyphic text into modern languages using our fine-tuned T5 model.
Image Recognition: Identify and classify hieroglyphic symbols from images using our CNN models.
Dataset: Access to a curated dataset of hieroglyphic symbols, labeled and categorized for training and evaluation.
